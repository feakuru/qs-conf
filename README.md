# My Quickshell config

This is my personal config for Quickshell. It includes a top bar and a bottom bar and multiple widgets. I should write/record a proper explanation here when I develop a fully functional version.

## Dependencies
- `jq`
- `sar`
- `nmcli`
- `pactl`
- `uv` with a Python 3.12 or greater available
- `xdg-terminal-exec` (available on Arch only as a separate AUR at the time of writing)
